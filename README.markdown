# User Interface Design Portfolio

This portfolio shows a selection of my the User Interface designs I have worked on over my career as a Web Librarian. 

In my current role as the Web Services Librarian, I am responsible for not only user interface and interaction design, but also user research, usability testing, analytics analysis, content strategy, accessibility audits, training, writing HTML and CSS markup for websites and designs, front end development in JavaScript, and even some back-end development using PHP and MySQL. But my main focus has always been on interface design.
